                        <p>Niagara Falls is an enormously popular tourist destination, and it also serves as a major source 
                            of electricity for Ontario. The city is connected to the U.S. side of the falls by several bridges,
                             including the Rainbow, Whirlpool, and Queenston-Lewiston bridges.Formed by the Niagara River, 
                             which drains Lake Erie into Lake Ontario before flowing out to the Atlantic Ocean through
                              the St. Lawrence River, the combined falls have the highest flow rate of any waterfall in 
                              North America that has a vertical drop of more than 50 m (160 ft).

                             famous Seawall.With so many lush towering trees, it's hard to believe at one time Stanley Park was a logging location.
                              Before it was a park, the site was logged from 1860-1880. At the tip of Stanley Park is Brockton Point, here there was to be a sawmill built.
                               The land was cleared for the sawmill, but it was never built. </p>

                             in a later and more elaborate version of the Gothic Revival style. The church faces onto Notre-Dame Street, directly across
                              from Place d'Armes in the heart of Old Montr√©al.
