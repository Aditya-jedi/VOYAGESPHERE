                        <p>Varadero, covering Cuba‚Äôs narrow Hicacos Peninsula, is a popular beach resort town. Along its 20km of
                             Atlantic Ocean coastline is a string of all-inclusive hotel and spa complexes, and a golf course.
                              Near the peninsula‚Äôs eastern tip is Reserva Ecol√≥gica Varahicacos, a preserve with trails and an ancient burial cave.
                               Parque Josone is a park with a pond and gardens.Considered by many as the world's most beautiful beach,
                                Varadero is part of a peninsula that stretches far out into the calm waters of the Atlantic. </p>

                        <p>La Habana Vieja (Old Havana), declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1982, is the historic
                             center of the city of Havana. It is formed by a harbor and the official center, the Plaza de Armas.
                              There you will find all kinds of picturesque monuments, fortresses, churches, palaces, etc.In 1982,
                               Old Havana was inscribed in the UNESCO World Heritage List, because of its unique Baroque and neoclassical architecture,
                                its fortifications, and its historical importance as a stop on the route to the New World.</p>

                        <img src="/images/valle-de-vinales.jpg" alt="Valle De Vinales" class="activity-image" height="400" width="760">
                        <p>The Vi√±ales Valley in the Sierra de los Organos near the western end of the island of Cuba is an outstanding karst landscape
                             encircled by mountains and dotted with spectacular dome-like limestone outcrops (mogotes) that rise as high as 300 m.
                             Vi√±ales is a town in western Cuba. Its main street is lined with colorful colonial-era wooden houses, including the Municipal Museum,
                              which explores the region‚Äôs history. Orchids and palms fill the sprawling Casa de Caridad Botanical Gardens. Vi√±ales serves as a gateway
                               to the Sierra de los Organos mountains and the Vi√±ales Valley</p>

                        <p>The Malecon in Havana is like the heart and soul of the city. It's a wide promenade right by the sea, and it's where Cubans love to gather.
                             The reason is simple: it's a place where you can take in stunning views of the ocean and the city skyline, especially during sunset.
                             Today the Malec√≥n remains Havana's most authentic open-air theater, sometimes dubbed 'the world's longest sofa,' where the whole city comes to meet, greet, date and debate.

                        <p>Old Square - The Plaza Vieja is a square located in Old Havana. It was designed in 1559 and is the most striking plaza in Havana from an architectural point of view.
                             Here the Cuban baroque coexists with the Art Nouveau inspired by the Gaudinian style.n 1982, Old Havana was inscribed in the UNESCO World Heritage List, because of
                              its unique Baroque and neoclassical architecture, its fortifications, and its historical importance as a stop on the route to the New World.</p>

                        <img src="/images/playa paraiso.jpg" alt="Playa Paraiso" class="activity-image" height="400" width="760">
                        <p>Playa Paraiso's powdery sand and pale blue waters are still pristine and the nearby reefs boast some of the best diving and snorkeling in the Caribbean.
                             Sea turtles, iguanas and a wide range of birds can be seen throughout the island. Like the rest of Cuba, Playa Paraiso has long been off limits to US visitors.
                             Playa Para√≠so (Paradise Beach) in Cayo Largo del Sur, Cuba, offers a pleasant and quiet walk among the waters of the warm Caribbean Sea that lives up to its name.</p>

                        <img src="/images/fusterlandia.jpg" alt="Fusterlandia" class="activity-image" height="400" width="760">
                        <p>Fusterlandia stretches way beyond Fuster's own residence. Over half the neighborhood has been given similar treatment, from street signs to bus stops to the local doctor's house.
                             Wandering around its quiet streets is a surreal and psychedelic experience.When Fuster began his mosaic project in 1975, Havana‚Äôs Jamainatas neighborhood was a run-down fishing community. 
                             Times were hard in post-revolutionary Cuba, and during Fidel Castro‚Äôs reign, </p>

                        <p>It is named after American writer Ernest Hemingway's boat, which popularized the spot in 1970 thanks to his novel Islands in the Stream. It's a strip of fine, shiny sand and warm,
                             turquoise-blue waters that you can't miss on your way to the Jardines del Rey (King's gardens) archipelago in the middle of the Caribbean.This much sought-after strip of sand is
                              regularly touted as Cuba's (and the Caribbean's) best beach, courtesy of its diamond-dust white sand and rugged 15m-high sand dunes (the largest of their kind in the Caribbean).</p>

                        <p>Cayo Largo's (and, perhaps, Cuba's) finest beach is the broad westward-facing Playa Sirena, where 2km of powdery white sand is wide enough to accommodate several football pitches.
                             Tourists on day trips from Havana and Varadero are often brought here.This page of IGN's Super Mario Sunshine Walkthrough contains the locations of every Blue Coin in Sirena Beach. 
                             Each world in Super Mario Sunshine contains 30 Blue Coins which are spread throughout multiple episodes, but not every episode contains a Blue Coin.</p>

                        <p>Cayo Blanco (Blanco Cay) is an islet located near Varadero, on the northern coast of Cuba, it is named for the fine white sand of its virtually untouched beaches.

                              You will be able to observe unique species such as black coral, which is in danger of extinction. In addition, you can rent jet skis to see the island
                               from a different perspective and get an even closer look at the mangroves.</p>
