                        <p>ongatapu's most famous cave is an over-loved, slightly eerie place full of stalactites and stalagmites, 
                            and blackened from the soot of flaming-frond torches and too much traffic. Inside is an underground freshwater pool where you can swim.</p>

                        <p>The Free Church of Tonga (also called the Centennial Church) is not just a local house of worship; it's also the name of a religious denomination.
                             The religion was established in 1885 by King George Tupou I and the missionary Reverend Shirley Waldemar Baker to break from Australia's Methodist church.</p>

                        <p>The main cathedral on Vavau is the St Joseph's Cathedral, a beautiful whitewashed Polynesian-style church standing on a high ground above the harbor and visible from many points in town.
                             Additional steps and staircases lead even higher from the street to the church.</p>

                        <p>The Centenary Chapel is a historic church located in Nuku'alofa, the capital city of Tonga. It was built in 1882 to commemorate the arrival of Christianity in Tonga and 
                            to celebrate the centennial anniversary of the establishment of the Free Wesleyan Church of Tonga.</p>
