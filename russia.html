                        <h3>Visit the ST. BASIL'S CATHEDRAL</h3>
                        <img src="/images/st-basil-cathedral-photo-1-1024x576.png" alt="Great Wall" class="activity-image" height="400" width="760">
                        <p>Saint Basil's Cathedral
                            Saint Basil's Cathedral was built between 1555 and 1561 by Ivan the Terrible in Moscow, Russia. Legend has it that the cathedral's builder was blinded post-construction so that a structure of its beauty could never be built again.
                             Part of its distinctive appearance can be attributed to the colorful domes and vivid redbrick towers. The domes belong to nine different chapels within the cathedral, and each dome is a symbol for the assault on the city of Kazan. The design of the cathedral draws from architectural designs found in Jerusalem, and holds strong religious meanings. When seen from the top, 
                            the eight domes surrounding the ninth dome in a circular fashion appear to form a star. 
                            The interior of the St Basil's Cathedral greatly differs compared to its exterior, comprising of modest decorations and narrow corridors.
                            The cathedral has suffered damage due to fires, looting, and other incidents on several occasions throughout its history. In one legend, the French ruler Napoleon even wanted to take
                             St. Basil‚Äôs Cathedral back to France with him. As this was not feasible, he instead ordered his army to destroy it so that no one else could occupy it. His army had prepared for attack and lit up the gunpowder, but a mysterious rain shower prevented any explosions from occurring.</p><br>

                    <p> Red Square has an almost rectangular shape and is 70 meters wide and 330 meters long.

In the northeast, the square is bounded by the GUM department store building and the old district of Kitay-gorod, in the northwest by the State Historical Museum and the Resurrection Gate and in the southeast by Saint Basil's Cathedral. Tverskaya Street begins to the northwest of the square behind the building of the State Historical Museum, and to the southeast is the so-called Basilius slope, which leads to the Moskva River, which goes down and over a bridge to the Zamoskvorechye District. Two streets branch off to the northeast from Red Square: Nikolskaya Street, which is named after the Nikolaus Tower of the Kremlin, which is directly opposite, and the Ilyinka (–ò–ª—å–∏–Ω–∫–∞), both of which have existed since the 14th century and were once important arteries of old Moscow. Today the square itself, with the exception of the access road leading through it to the Savior Gate of the Kremlin, is a pedestrian zone.</p><br>

Francesco Bartolomeo Rastrelli completed an expansion from 1747 to 1756 for Elizabeth of Russia. The palace-ensemble along with the city center is recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.</p><br>
