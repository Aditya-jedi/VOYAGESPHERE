                        <p>An aerial lift, also known as a cable car or ropeway, is a means of cable transport in which cabins,  ars, gondolas, or open chairs are hauled above the ground by means of one or more cables. Aerial lift systems are frequently employed in a mountainous territory where roads are relatively difficult to build and use, and have seen extensive use in mining. Aerial lift systems are relatively easy to move and have been used to cross rivers and ravines. In more recent times, the cost-effectiveness and flexibility of aerial lifts have seen an increase of gondola lift being integrated into urban public transport systems.

                        <p>The beach is located in the south side of Island of Margarita, Venezuela, about three kilometers away from the island's International Airport. The trade winds blow steadily at 15 to 30 knots during most of the year, and the shallow sea extends south of the beach for several hundred meters, allowing fallen windsurfers to stand on the flat sand bottom. As in most of the Caribbean, the water is usually between 21 and 27 °C, warm enough to allow windsurfing for hours wearing just a swimsuit or a bikini. On a typical day, up to one thousand windsurfers may be seen sailing at any given moment, along with practitioners of other similar water sports.</p><br>
