                        <img src="/images/skull island.jpg" alt="Skull Island" class="activity-image" height="400" width="760">
                        <p>Skull Island is a tiny island full of human skulls, an altar, and graves. It's the most holy place in the area and a tourist attraction.
                             These skulls were not always present on the island but only put there in the early 20th century. As in many countries local customs were not approved by Christian invaders.</p>

                        <img src="/images/tenaru falls.jpg" alt="Tenaru Falls" class="activity-image" height="400" width="760">
                        <p>At 63m, these waterfalls are spectacular. They are a fairly easy four-hour walk (return) from a tiny settlement about 2km south of Tenaru Village. It's flat and shady all the way.

                        <img src="/images/marovo lagoon.jpg" alt="Marovo Lagoon" class="activity-image" height="400" width="760">
                        <p>The Marovo Lagoon is the largest saltwater lagoon in the world. The area is an exceptional part of the Coral Triangle, in particular for its high coral and fish diversity which is only comparable to Raja Ampat in Indonesia. 
                            One of its most distinguishing features is its double barrier reef and island formations.</p>

                        <p>The Vilu Military Museum is east of Honiara. It is an open air museum that contains decaying US and Japanese aircraft and artillery from the Second World War. It also houses the humble memorial to HMAS Canberra,
